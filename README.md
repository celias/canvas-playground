# Viewing a sketch

To run a canvas-sketch JavaScript file, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install canvas-sketch-cli**: Open your terminal and run the following command to install the canvas-sketch CLI globally:
    ```sh
    npm install -g canvas-sketch-cli
    ```

3. **Run the canvas-sketch file**: Use the canvas-sketch CLI to run your JavaScript file. Replace `your-sketch-file.js` with the name of your file:
    ```sh
    canvas-sketch your-sketch-file.js
    ```

4. **View your sketch**: The canvas-sketch CLI will open a new browser window displaying your sketch. Any changes you make to the file will automatically reload the sketch in the browser.

That's it! You should now be able to run and view your canvas-sketch JavaScript file.
